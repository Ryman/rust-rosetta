/*
	Generic function to find max value in list.
	return an Option that can contains a reference to the max of the list

	The type T requires to implement Ord to be compared.

	'a is used to define the lifetime of the returned reference.
	<'a, ...>: define a lifetime named 'a.
	(lst: &'a Vec<T>): 'a is equal to the lifetime of lst
	Option<&'a T>> the returned reference is defined to have the lifetime 'a, which is the same lifetime of the vector
	This means that the reference contained in the Option will be valid as long as the vector is valid.
	In fact, this mechanism exist to avoid having a refence to something that does not exist anymore. One of the Rust safety mechanism.

	For more information about lifetime, see http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/guide-lifetimes.html
